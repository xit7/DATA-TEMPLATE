    "| **Z-score / Std. Deviation Check**                   | Stable metrics with low noise              | Compare observed value to historical mean ± SD                            | Simple, fast, widely understood; good for thresholds       | Assumes normality; bad for sparse or seasonal data                                       |\n",
    "| **Rolling Mean + Confidence Bands**                  | Metrics with drifting means or mild trends | Compute rolling mean & rolling SD; flag points outside band               | Easy to visualize; adapts to mild drift                    | Sensitive to window choice; noisy for small windows                                      |\n",
    "| **Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA, ETS)**             | Seasonal or trending data                  | Forecast expected values; compare actual vs. forecast CI                  | Handles trend & seasonality; clear uncertainty bounds      | Requires enough history; more complex to tune                                            |\n",
    "| **STL Decomposition + Residual Detection**           | Strong seasonality (weekly/monthly)        | Decompose into trend/seasonal/residual; flag large residuals              | Very intuitive; robust for product metrics with cycles     | Still requires good data; residual thresholds subjective                                 |\n",
    "| **Bootstrapping (Resampling)**                       | Non-normal, sparse, or irregular data      | Simulate many possible histories to estimate probability of observed drop | Distribution-free; works with messy data                   | Slower; requires enough historical points to resample                                    |\n",
    "| **Bayesian Change-Point Detection (BOCPD, Prophet)** | Sudden shifts; structural breaks           | Estimate probability that underlying process changed                      | Very strong for abrupt changes; real-time capable          | More advanced; may be overkill for simple metrics                                        |\n",
    "| **Peer Comparison / Cohort Baseline**                | When individual data is noisy              | Compare user vs. similar users’ change pattern                            | Controls for external factors; great for product analytics | Requires good cohort definitions; can't detect individual anomalies if group changes too |\n",
