    "| **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)** | % of customers rating an experience as “satisfied” or better (e.g., 4–5 on a 5-pt scale). | Use uplift in satisfaction to estimate reduced churn or increased repeat purchase. | A +10-point CSAT improvement reduces churn from 6% → 5%, increasing avg. lifetime by 3 months = +\\$60 CLV per customer. |\n",
    "| **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** | %Promoters − %Detractors → proxy for word-of-mouth advocacy. | Estimate revenue via referrals or new user acquisition driven by promoters. | NPS up by 20 → 5% more organic signups; each new user worth \\$100 → +\\$500k revenue. |\n",
    "| **Customer Effort Score (CES)** | Measures ease of achieving a goal (e.g., resolving an issue). | Quantify via reduction in support tickets or handling cost per issue. | CES improvement saves 1,000 support calls/month × \\$5 = \\$5,000 savings. |\n",
    "| **Customer Retention / Churn** | % of customers who stay or leave per period. | Convert to monetary lifetime (1 ÷ churn) × ARPU = CLV. | Churn 5% → lifetime 20 mo × \\$50 = \\$1,000 CLV; reduce churn to 4% → 25 mo × \\$50 = \\$1,250 CLV (+\\$250 per customer). |\n",
    "| **Customer Loyalty / Repeat Purchase Rate** | % of users making ≥2 purchases. | Calculate incremental revenue from repeat customers. | 20% more repeat buyers spending \\$80 → +\\$16 per user on average. |\n",
    "| **Referral Value (k-factor)** | Average new users generated by existing users. | Each referred user’s CLV × referral rate. | 0.1 new users per existing × \\$500 CLV = \\$50 viral value per customer. |\n",
    "| **Service Recovery / Complaint Handling** | How well issues are resolved when something goes wrong. | Estimate retained CLV from “saved” customers after a negative event. | Retaining 50% of would-churn customers (worth \\$800 CLV) = \\$400/customer saved. |\n",
    "| **UX Improvements (Conversion Impact)** | Better usability or onboarding flow → higher conversion rate. | Model incremental conversions × ARPU. | New checkout raises conv. 2% on 100k visits × \\$60/order = +\\$120k. |\n",
    "| **Support Satisfaction** | Post-interaction CSAT (after helpdesk contact). | Fewer follow-ups → lower cost per resolution. | 10% fewer escalations × \\$10 cost each = \\$1 per contact saved. |"
