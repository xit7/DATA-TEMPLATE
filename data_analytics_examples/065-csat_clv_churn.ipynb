    "| **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** | %Promoters − %Detractors → proxy for word-of-mouth advocacy. | Estimate revenue via referrals or new user acquisition driven by promoters. | NPS up by 20 → 5% more organic signups; each new user worth \\$100 → +\\$500k revenue. |\n",

    "| **Service Recovery / Complaint Handling** | How well issues are resolved when something goes wrong. | Estimate retained CLV from “saved” customers after a negative event. | Retaining 50% of would-churn customers (worth \\$800 CLV) = \\$400/customer saved. |\n",
    "| **UX Improvements (Conversion Impact)** | Better usability or onboarding flow → higher conversion rate. | Model incremental conversions × ARPU. | New checkout raises conv. 2% on 100k visits × \\$60/order = +\\$120k. |\n",
    "| **Support Satisfaction** | Post-interaction CSAT (after helpdesk contact). | Fewer follow-ups → lower cost per resolution. | 10% fewer escalations × \\$10 cost each = \\$1 per contact saved. |"
