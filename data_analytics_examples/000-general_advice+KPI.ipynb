    "# How to think like a data scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clean the data**. Do not assume data is clean\n",
    "2. **Normalize**. Let's say you're making a list of popular wedding destinations. You could count the number of people flying in for a wedding, but unless you consider the total number of air travellers coming to that city as well, you'll just get a list of cities with busy airports.\n",
    "3. **Consider Outliers**. Excluding outliers can be a mistake, as well as just including them without a doubt. Outliers can hold important information (e.g. customers that use your product much mor often than the average → leads to **qualitative insights**). But they are not good for **building a model**.\n",
    "4. **Consider Seasonality**\n",
    "5. **Consider Context**. Do not ignore size when reporting growth. E.g. when you are just starting your product, technically, your dad signing up count as doubling your user base.\"\n",
    "6. **Avoid data vomit**. A dashboard is not of much use, if you do not know where to look.\n",
    "7. **Avoid metrics that cry wolf**. If you set alarms with a too low threshold, they get sensitive and \"whiny\", you'll start to ignore them.\n",
    "8. **Combine data from other sources**. Do not develop the \"not collected here\" syndrome and gain insights from mashing up data.\n",
    "9. **Do not focus on noise**. We as humans see patterns everywhere, because we are \"hardwired\" like that. Do not develop **vanity metrics**, step back, and look at the bigger picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "# OMTM - One Metric That Matters\n",
    "> OMTM = a temporary focus metric. The **single most important metric** you should focus on **right now**, given your stage of growth, your business model, and your immediate goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "1. Example for a product company looking into **new feature adoption**\n",
    "* **Context**: You release a new collaboration feature in your SaaS tool.\n",
    "* **OMTM**: “% of active users who try the new feature within 30 days of release.”\n",
    "* **Why?**\n",
    "  * It directly measures adoption.\n",
    "  * If adoption is low, it triggers deeper questions: awareness? UX friction? Lack of value?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example for a company rolling out features consistently across products\n",
    "* This is trickier (more meta) but here’s a good OMTM-style approach:\n",
    "* **Context**: You have multiple product lines (say, a suite like Microsoft 365). You want to measure not just adoption of one feature, but how well your teams are consistently rolling out and integrating features across the suite.\n",
    "* **OMTM Idea**: “Median time (days) from feature release to 50% adoption across all products.”\n",
    "* **Why?**\n",
    "    * Captures both speed of rollout and depth of adoption.\n",
    "    * Easy to track over time — you want that number to go down.\n",
    "    * Forces teams to think about cross-product consistency and communication effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The idea is**: instead of drowning in dashboards, focus your team around one number that drives learning and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In larger companies**, it’s often adapted into **North Star Metrics or Key Results (OKRs)**, because focusing on just one number is sometimes too narrow."
