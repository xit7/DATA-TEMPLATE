    "# How to think like a data scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clean the data**. Do not assume data is clean\n",
    "2. **Normalize**. Let's say you're making a list of popular wedding destinations. You could count the number of people flying in for a wedding, but unless you consider the total number of air travellers coming to that city as well, you'll just get a list of cities with busy airports.\n",
    "3. **Consider Outliers**. Excluding outliers can be a mistake, as well as just including them without a doubt. Outliers can hold important information (e.g. customers that use your product much mor often than the average → leads to **qualitative insights**). But they are not good for **building a model**.\n",
    "4. **Consider Seasonality**\n",
    "5. **Consider Context**. Do not ignore size when reporting growth. E.g. when you are just starting your product, technically, your dad signing up count as doubling your user base.\"\n",
    "6. **Avoid data vomit**. A dashboard is not of much use, if you do not know where to look.\n",
    "7. **Avoid metrics that cry wolf**. If you set alarms with a too low threshold, they get sensitive and \"whiny\", you'll start to ignore them.\n",
    "8. **Combine data from other sources**. Do not develop the \"not collected here\" syndrome and gain insights from mashing up data.\n",
    "9. **Do not focus on noise**. We as humans see patterns everywhere, because we are \"hardwired\" like that. Do not develop **vanity metrics**, step back, and look at the bigger picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "# OMTM - One Metric That Matters\n",
    "> OMTM = a temporary focus metric. The **single most important metric** you should focus on **right now**, given your stage of growth, your business model, and your immediate goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "1. Example for a product company looking into **new feature adoption**\n",
    "* **Context**: You release a new collaboration feature in your SaaS tool.\n",
    "* **OMTM**: “% of active users who try the new feature within 30 days of release.”\n",
    "* **Why?**\n",
    "  * It directly measures adoption.\n",
    "  * If adoption is low, it triggers deeper questions: awareness? UX friction? Lack of value?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example for a company rolling out features consistently across products\n",
    "* This is trickier (more meta) but here’s a good OMTM-style approach:\n",
    "* **Context**: You have multiple product lines (say, a suite like Microsoft 365). You want to measure not just adoption of one feature, but how well your teams are consistently rolling out and integrating features across the suite.\n",
    "* **OMTM Idea**: “Median time (days) from feature release to 50% adoption across all products.”\n",
    "* **Why?**\n",
    "    * Captures both speed of rollout and depth of adoption.\n",
    "    * Easy to track over time — you want that number to go down.\n",
    "    * Forces teams to think about cross-product consistency and communication effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The idea is**: instead of drowning in dashboards, focus your team around one number that drives learning and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In larger companies**, it’s often adapted into **North Star Metrics or Key Results (OKRs)**, because focusing on just one number is sometimes too narrow."

    "# 5 Stages of Lean Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about: What stage are we at?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EMPATHY**: Identify a real problem and a real solution. It addresses the riskiest question: Will anyone care?\n",
    "   * Your job is to get inside someone else's head.\n",
    "   * Get out of the building → qualitative feedback.\n",
    "   * **Outcome**:\n",
    "     * You have conducted enough qualitative interviews to feel **_confident that you've found a problem worth solving_**.\n",
    "     * You understand your customers well enough\n",
    "     * You believe your **_solution will meet the needs of you customers_**\n",
    "2. **STICKINESS**: Will the dogs eat the dog food? Make your mistakes with a small, friendly audience before throwing the masses at it.\n",
    "   * Focus is squarely on **retention and engagement**. \n",
    "   * daily/weekly/monthly active users; segment **metrics by cohort**\n",
    "   * when do users become inactive; how to reactivate; features engaged users spend time with\n",
    "   * Remember: the **MVP is a process**, not a product (instead it is a tool for figuring out which product to build). Improve and iterate with focus on your core metrics.\n",
    "   * **Goal**:\n",
    "     * Retention\n",
    "3. **VIRALITY**: Sharing helps grow, but also verifies that what you have made is good.\n",
    "   * 3 types: inherent, artifical, word of mouth\n",
    "   * What's your viral coefficient?\n",
    "4. **REVENUE**: Will people open their pocketbooks? Can you charge them enough to fund your ongoing operation?\n",
    "   * The core equation for Revenue: money a customer brings in minus the cost of acquiring that customer.\n",
    "   * You are moving from proving you have the right product to proving you have a real business.\n",
    "   * **Goal**:\n",
    "     * Figure out where to focus: more revenue per customer; more customers; more efficiencies; greater frequency etc.\n",
    "5. **SCALE**: You need channels to amortize the cost of sales and distribution. You need a ecosystem to cross the \"hole in the middle\" from niche player to bug company.\n",
    "   * How to scale (M. Porter): a) niche market → **segmentation** strategy, b) Focus on being efficient -> **cost** strategy, or c) be unique -> **differentiation** strategy\n",
    "   * **Goal**: **THE THREE THREES** - a simple way of focusing on metrics that gives you the ability to change while avoiding **management-by-opinion**.\n",
    "     * **_3 big, fundamental assumptions_** (e.g. we will make money from parents)\n",
    "     * **_3 actions to take_** (for each board level assumption take 3 tactical actions, e.g. product enhancements, marketing strategies)\n",
    "     * **_3 experiments to run_** (for each of the actions, perform 3 tasks, e.g. 3 experiments you are running and how to choose the winner)"
