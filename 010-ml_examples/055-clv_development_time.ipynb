    "I want to know the approach for predicting the Customer Lifetime Value for a user of a subscription model (say an Adobe cloud product). So with some historic data about subscription history (what product, what price, daily usage, monthly usage, general churn rate etc) the task is to predict how a CLV would develop over the course of the next 12 month. A second challenge is to give a recommendation on how to improve the CLV (e.g. by offering discounts, or cross-selling other products etc).\n",
