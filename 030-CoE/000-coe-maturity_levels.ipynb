    "|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| **Data Foundation** | Siloed, limited access. Questionable veracity. | Org invests in better data access. Key metrics are “certified”. | Defined owners and data stewards. Metrics and dashboard maintenance. Robust data infra for most data. | Cutting-edge data infrastructure allows for computationally intensive DS work (predictive modeling / ML / LLMs). |\n",
    "| **Data Culture** | Some employees understand the value of data. No or limited data-driven experimentation / launch culture. Analysts focused on reporting and dashboards. | Some teams integrate data-driven processes and decision-making around experimentation and launch. Analysts start to work on DS-related areas (predictions, forecasting, experiment design). | Key organizational motions (Planning, CA/PPC, Product Launches, Marketing, etc.) centered around data products owned by DS/DE teams. | Org leans on data to help innovate for the future. New and innovative data analysis based on the latest science (e.g., applying advances in agentic systems for platform use cases). |\n",
    "| **Data Tooling** | Ad-hoc analyst engagement. Mostly reactive. Stakeholder-initiated analysis of specific questions. | Formalized engagements with embedded analysis. Certain reporting and analysis are operationalized (OKRs, Cost, etc.). | Analysis in several areas is streamlined and well-defined. Specialized horizontal DS teams (OKR DS, Forecasting DS, Experiments DS). DS team is key for operational decision-making. | DS team is considered essential to both strategic planning and operational decision-making. |\n",
    "| **Data Activation** | Reporting on key metrics. Deep dives in anomalies on request. | Operational analytics — KPIs reported in a set cadence. Planned deep dives and experiments to uncover insights in specific areas. | New insights and experimentation ideas to drive customer retention and revenue. | Identifying feature gaps and latent problems (e.g., surfacing customer pain points, predicting product usage, etc.). |\n"
